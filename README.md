# Maryland Election Cluster Analysis
Exploring [Maryland's Official Turnout Statistics for the 2016 General Election](https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2016/index.html) in Maryland by Party and Precinct.

Original dataset used can be found [here](https://github.com/CamilaCamacho/baltimore_election_cluster_analysis/blob/master/Official%20by%20Party%20and%20Precinct.csv).

## Business Question 
Define an initial business question
Define the data-related questions and metrics

### Maryland Election Data: How are Maryland voting precincts grouped based on how they vote (polls, early voting, absentee, provisional)? 

### Baltimore City Election Data: How are Baltimore City voting precincts grouped based on voter turnout, number of Democrat/Republican votes, or other related metrics?

## Data Analysis & Visualization
Perform calculations and model-building to answer the data-related questions
Relate the data findings back to your initial question and outline what your cluster model tells us about the related organization


Analyzed Excel documents with Excel formulas and data visualizations
* Excel Data Analysis
Use Excel Solver to perform a cluster analysis for an organization listed in the project outline. Calculate z-scores, define clusters, and identify which data points are categorized in each cluster.


## Data Analysis & Visualization
* README that summarizes findings (less than 250 words), outlines data analytics process, includes at least one data visualization, and provides links to outside sources
* What do your findings mean and why might this be important for an organization relevant to this datasource? Highlight the characteristics of each cluster, how this information should be used in practice, and what additional data might be useful for further analysis.
* Excel Data Visualization
Create at least one visualization that shows the groupings based on your cluster analysis. This should show either the groupings in your cluster analysis (the list of data for each cluster) or the characteristics of the cluster nodes.
