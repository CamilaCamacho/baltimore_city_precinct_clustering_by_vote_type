Original Excel documents

Analyzed Excel documents with Excel formulas and data visualizations
* Excel Data Analysis
Use Excel Solver to perform a cluster analysis for an organization listed in the project outline. Calculate z-scores, define clusters, and identify which data points are categorized in each cluster.


README that summarizes findings (less than 250 words), outlines data analytics process, includes at least one data visualization, and provides links to outside sources
* Data Interpretation
What do your findings mean and why might this be important for an organization relevant to this datasource? Highlight the characteristics of each cluster, how this information should be used in practice, and what additional data might be useful for further analysis.
* Excel Data Visualization
Create at least one visualization that shows the groupings based on your cluster analysis. This should show either the groupings in your cluster analysis (the list of data for each cluster) or the characteristics of the cluster nodes.
